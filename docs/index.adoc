Over the past few years, I have been increasingly fascinated with Operations Research and its applications: Economic models; Scheduling; Engineering & Design; etcetera. Operations Research has provided a wealth of good to society as a whole. This library is a general resource for using the F# Operations Research module. Hope you have fun with it.
