== Download tools

In order to use the module you will require the https://dotnet.microsoft.com[dotnet SDK]. The latest version of the module requires version 5. Once installed test your installation using `dotnet --info`. The output will show which SDKs are installed (as it is possible to install more than one for compatibility).


== New project

We'll begin by creating a program and including the F#OR module.

[%hardbreaks]
. Create a standard dotnet console project
+
[source, bash]
-----
dotnet new console -lang F# -n or
-----
+
. Add the Operations Research module from https://www.nuget.org/packages/OperationsResearch[Nuget]
+
[source, bash]
-----
dotnet add package OperationsResearch --version X.X.X
-----

Now you are ready to start solving some problems.
